\section{Conclusion}
The goal with this project was to create a compiler for a programming language of the groups own design.
The resulting solution is the programming language HCL.
HCL is designed with beginners in mind, while also introducing high-order functionality.
This goal has, mostly, been reached.
While the language has not been tested by actual beginners as of the writing of this report, and therefore we cannot conclude that it is easier for beginners, HCL is indeed a working language with high-order functionality.

During development a "test-driven" method was employed.
This meant that the entirety of the compiler, from the lexer to the code generation, with complete integration tests is completely tested.
This means that the individual parts of the compiler
