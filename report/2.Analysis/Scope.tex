\section{Scope}
As stated in the above analysis, the purpose of this project is to design, create and implement a
programming language for the Arduino platform that is simple for beginners to use, whilst still teaching the
fundamentals of programming.
In other terms, the language is meant to enable beginners to quickly and easily write
code that can be executed, without losing the functionality of a high-level language.

It is imperative to consider the needed functionality in order responsibly compose a language for
beginners.
After conducting interviews with gymnasium students who can be described as beginners in programming,
it was decided that the language for this project should be utilized as an introductory language 
beginners can use, before switching to a full-fleshed language, to obtain a somewhat basic idea of
programming.
