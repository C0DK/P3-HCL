\section{Problem statement}
Based on the analysis the following problem statement is defined:
\begin{center}
	\textit{Students have trouble understanding the basic concepts of programming, because the languages they are being taught are complicated, the reason being that they are not designed with novices in mind.}
	\textit{The group will try to solve this, by designing a simpler language, targeted at novices.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can English-like syntax be implemented in a programming language?
	\item How can high-order functions be made intuitive?
	\item How can the programming paradigm be simplififed?
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
