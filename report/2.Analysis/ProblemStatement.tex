\section{Problem statement}
Based on the analysis the following problem statement was defined:
\begin{center}
	%1: 
	%How can a simpler programming language for the Arduino platform, that increases beginners interest and motivation for programming, be developed?
	%2:
	How can a programming language that eases development for the Arduino platform be developed?

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can simplicity and a quick development process be ensured? %means that we integrate our processes and whatnot in the project
	\item How can the basic programming concepts be taught, in a manner that ensures, that the user can recognize and use the concepts in more advanced languages?
	\item How can programming language be implemented in a manner that uses functions for most operations? 
	%Make a subitem regarding ensuring functions are an integral part of the language
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
%Dont know if we should add more here.
%If you have any ideas for different problem statements, do feel free to add them :)
