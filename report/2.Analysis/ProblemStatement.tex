%This is the problem statement.
%This semester the problem statement is different from our usual problem statements, in that it is actually a statement.

\section{Problem statement}
Based on the analysis the following problem statement was defined:
\begin{center}
	Students have trouble understanding the basic concepts of programming, because the languages they are being taught are complicated, the reason being that they are not designed with beginners in mind
	The group will try to solve this, by designing a simpler language, targeted at beginners.
	%How can a programming language that eases development for the Arduino platform be developed?

\begin{itemize}
	\item How can simplicity and a quick development process be ensured?
	\item How can the basic programming concepts be taught, in a manner that ensures, that the user can recognize and use the concepts in more advanced languages?
	\item How can programming language be implemented in a manner that uses functions for most operations? 
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
