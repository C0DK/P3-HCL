\section{Problem statement}
Based on the analysis the following problem statement is defined:
\begin{center}
	Students have trouble understanding the basic concepts of programming, because the languages they are being taught are complicated, the reason being that they are not designed with beginners in mind
	The group will try to solve this, by designing a simpler language, targeted at beginners.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Can english-like syntax be implemented in a programming language?
	\item How can High-order functions be made intuitive?
	\item How can the programming paradigm be simplififed?
\end{itemize}
\end{center}
