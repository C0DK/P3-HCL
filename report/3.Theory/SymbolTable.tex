\subsection{Symbol Table}
This section concerns with the implementation of the symbol table. 
first, the interface implemented by the the symbol table will be presented.
Second, all considerations through the design process will be discussed.
This will serve as the reasoning behind the final implementation details.
Last, the problematic aspect of method overloading will be touched upon.

\textbf{Symbol Table Interface}\\
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,label=lis:STInterface,caption=The interface which all symbol table implementations must implement.]

	fun openScope()
	fun closeScope()
	fun enterSymbol(name: String, type: TreeNode.Type): Boolean
	fun retrieveSymbol(name: String): Symbol
	fun declaredLocally(name: String): Boolean
}
