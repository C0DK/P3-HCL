%This section covers the implementation of the lexer
\section{Lexer implementation}
As described in section \ref{LexerChoice}, it was decided that the lexer (and therefore the parser), would be written by hand.
As mentioned in section \ref{REFTOPROGRAMLANGUAGECHOICE}, the compiler for HCL will be written in kotlin.
Below is an explanation of the implementation of the lexer.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,label=lis:Lexer,caption=The Lexer .,firstnumber=1]


\end{lstlisting}
The lexer class implements the ILexer interface and accepts an input string, which is expected to be text.
The ILexer defines a getTokenSequence function, which will give the token sequence and an inputLine function

\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,label=lis:Lexer,caption=The Lexer .,firstnumber=8]
class Lexer(private val inputContent: String) : ILexer {
\end{lstlisting}
