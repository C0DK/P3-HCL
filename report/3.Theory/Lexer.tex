%This section describes the Lexer
\section{Lexer}
The first part of the compiler handles the syntax analysis phase. 
The point of this phase is to verify whether a given input string, which will often be a source code file, is syntactically correct.
Syntactical correctness is defined according to predefined rules, most often according to a context free grammar (CFG), often as a Extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF). 
The CFG for HCL, is defined as an EBNF in section  \ref{<InsertContextFreeGrammarRefHere>}.
Should the input string be syntactically correct, the string is broken down into tokens. According to the EBNF, the tokens in HCL will represent:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Keywords
	\item Literals
	\item Identifiers
	\item Type declarations
	\item Seperators, special characters
	\item Line terminnators
\end{itemize}
