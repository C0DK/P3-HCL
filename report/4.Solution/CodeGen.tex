\section{Code Generation}
This section describes the methodology and implementation of the code generation aspect of the compiler for HCL. 

During generation the HCL code is translated to \texttt{C++} code, which is subsequently compiled using a \texttt{C++} compiler.
The \texttt{C++} code contains preprocessor directives to make sure it works cross-platform on Arduino, Windows, and Linux.
