\section{Code Generation}
This section describes the methodology and implementation of the code generation aspect of the compiler for HCL. 

During generation the HCL code is translated into C++, which is subsequently compiled using a C++ compiler.
If an Arduino board is connected to the computer, the compiler generated code that is specific to the Arduino language. 

The overall code generation is done within the \texttt{ProgramGenerator} class.
The class' responsibility is limited to calling the three predominant generators, namely \texttt{CodeGenerator}, \texttt{TypeGenerator} and \texttt{MainGenerator}.
Other than calling the other classes, the \texttt{ProgramGenerator} class also adds return code to the AST to make sure that the program returns when terminated. 

Snippet \ref{lis:programGen} shows the \textit{generate} function from \texttt{ProgramGenerator}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Kotlin,label=lis:programGen,caption=The implementation of \textit{generate} in \texttt{ProgramGenerator}.]
override fun generate(ast: AbstractSyntaxTree): List<FilePair> = 
	listOf(
		HelperHeaders.constList,
		HelperHeaders.ftoa,
		FilePair("builtin.h", CodeGenerator().generate(ast.builtins())),
		FilePair("types.h", TypeGenerator().generate(ast)),
		FilePair("main.cpp", MainGenerator().generate(ast.addReturnCode().notBuiltins()))
)
\end{lstlisting}

The function first creates header files for the help-classes \textit{constList}(3) and \textit{ftoa}(4), which allows for the use of the list-type in C++, and for converting doubles to text. 
The function then creates the header file for the built-in functions of the language(5).
When the \textit{generate} function within the \texttt{CodeGenerator} class is called with the built-in functions from the language, it formats the functions to resemble valid C++ function declarations, whilst also adding descriptive comments of its functionality.
The resulting text is written to a file that serves as a header-file for the final program. \\
The next line of code (6) call the \textit{generate} function from the \texttt{TypeGenerator} class.
This class is responsible for formatting tuples in the language by creating equivalent \textit{struct} declarations in C++.
The function will fetch all tuples within the inputtet AST, format them, and write the result to a header file.
Before returning, the function will also generate functions for each tuple found.
These generated functions will allow the tuple to be printed using the \textit{toText} keyword, and will also allow the tuples to return a specific element from within themselves.\\
