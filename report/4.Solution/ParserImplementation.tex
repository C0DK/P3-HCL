\section{Parser implementation}
\label{parserImplemention}
In the following section, the parser implementation details will be touched upon.

Due to the nature of HCL, the parser can be implemented as a single pass parser. 
This is because the user may not access any variables that has not yet been declared. 
As HCL is a LL(K) language, an LL(k) recursive decent parser is a reasonable choice.

Both syntactical and contextual analysis is done within the parser. 
This means that there is no additional post parser type-checking or contextual analysis step. 
A major reason for doing in line contextual analysis is the way functions are invoked in HCL. 
The only way to know if an identifier is a function call, is by analyzing the types. 
This means that to create a proper AST, the type-checking must be done in line. 
It could also potentially be done afterwards, but that would require quite a large amount of post processing, which would be a lot more complex, than just doing type-checking within the parser. 
This also means that the outputted AST is in fact already a decorated syntax tree. 
For instance, function calls already has information on its return type, even though the function may have multiple return types based on the overloading of the function.

\subsection{Implementing a recursive decent parser}
A LL(K) recursive decent parser will do lookaheads until it is aware what branch should be parsed.
This can be figured out from the first and follow sets, that can be produced from the CFG.
Once it determines which non-terminal to parse it will call a method that attempts to parse that part.
The method can then accept terminals or parse further non-terminals.
It should be the responsibility of the accept method to advance the lexical token stream.

Below is a quick and concrete example from HCL. 

The line to parse is "num x = 5" The token stream to parse will look as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Number type
	\item Identifier = x
	\item Equals
	\item Number Literal = 5
	\item End of line
\end{itemize}

The parser will see that the first token is a number type. 
Since only declarations have types in its first set, the parser now knows that it should parse a declaration.

The EBNF reveals that a declaration is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Non-terminal Type
	\item Terminal Identifier
	\item Optional
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Terminal Equals
		\item Non-terminal Expression
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Based on this, the \textit{parseDeclaration} is implemented as seen in snippet \ref{lis:parseDeclaration}.
Do note, the final parse declaration method is a little more complex due to type inference and type checking.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Kotlin,label=lis:parseDeclaration,caption=A simplified version of the parse declaration method from the parser.]
private fun parseDeclaration(): TreeNode.Command.Declaration {
    val type = parseType()
    val identifierToken = accept<Token.Identifier>()
    val identifier = AstNode.Command.Expression.Value.Identifier(identifierToken.value)
    val expression = if (current.token == Token.SpecialChar.Equals) {
	    accept<Token.SpecialChar.Equals>()
	    parseExpression()
    } else null
    return TreeNode.Command.Declaration(type, identifier, expression)
}
\end{lstlisting}

As the snippet shows, the method will parse the type, accept the identifier, accept the equal sign, and finally it will parse the expression.

\textbf{Deciding what to parse}\\
The sealed classes, along with the pattern matching of Kotlin, are excellent tools in deciding what should be parsed. 
In snippet \ref{lis:parseCommand} a subset of the parse command method is shown. 
If the current token is a type, a declaration should be passed. 
If the current token is an identifier, it is the next token that determines whether to parse an assignment or an expression.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Kotlin,label=lis:parseCommand,caption=A simplified version of the parse declaration method from the parser.]
private fun parseCommand(): AstNode.Command {
    val command = when (current.token) {
	    is Token.Type -> parseDeclaration()
	    is Token.Identifier ->
		    if (peek().token == Token.SpecialChar.Equals) parseAssignment() 
		    else parseExpression()
    
    ...
    
    flushNewLine()
    return command
}
\end{lstlisting}

% we may also need to document some of the complex parts of the parser, but we will wait with that, until it is actually more or less completed.
